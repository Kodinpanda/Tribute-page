<p>Sridevi <b>was renowned for her naturalistic acting abilities, her comic timing, and her graceful dancing skills</b>. She was among the few female stars in Hindi cinema who could steer a movie’s commercial fate on her own merit. She starred in some of the biggest hits in the 1970s and the ’90s, and won acclaim for her sensitive portrayals of women thrown into challenging situations.</p>

<p>Sridevi <b>made an impact right from when she first appeared on the screen as a child</b>. Her final release was Ravi Udyawar’s crime procedural Mom in 2017, in which she plays a mother who seeks revenge for her daughter’s rape.</p>
